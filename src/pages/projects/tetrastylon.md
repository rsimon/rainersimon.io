An online database and web presence for an archaeological research project that studies 
the development of a specific ancient housing type, the Tetrastyle Courtyard House.

The client was looking for a cost-effective solution for a custom online database. They needed 
a user-friendly interface for managing a mix for content: structured vocabulary, 
numeric fields, rich text, geo-coordinate data, and image uploads. A second requirement was a
public website to search, browse and export the project data, with responsive layout and
mobile-friendly maps.
