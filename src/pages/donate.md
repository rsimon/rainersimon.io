# Become a Sponsor

You can support my Open Source work financially through my [Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/rainersimon).

If you prefer a one-time donation, you can donate directly via [Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/dR67tN3mAgDq0BqdQT).

Your donation will help me cover server hosting and domain registration costs, and spend more time on making 
Annotorious and RecogitoJS better for everyone. Thank you for your support!
